### Python for Experiential Learning in Science
is the main theme at SHD India 2018
<p>
We believe that python can change the way we learn and teach science. We will be experimenting with Python powered open source science lab tools like <strong>ExpEYES</strong> , <strong>SEELablet</strong> and <strong>KuttyPy</strong>. There will also be workshops on <strong>Python for young scientists</strong> and lot of fun with various sensors and  bat detectors.

**Python powered Laser Show** A group of science lovers will be working on this interesting hack idea.
