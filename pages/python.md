### We Love Python
The main theme at SHD India 2018 is **Python for Experiential Learning in Science**

We believe that python can change the way we learn and teach science. We will be experimenting with Python powered open source science lab tools like ExpEYES, SEELablet and KuttyPy. There will also be workshops on #Python for young scientists and lot of fun with various sensors and  bat detectors.

**Python powered Laser Show** A group of science lovers will be working on this interesting hack idea.
